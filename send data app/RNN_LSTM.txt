Long Short-Term Memory Network or LSTM, is a variation of a recurrent neural network (RNN) 
that is quite effective in predicting the long sequences of data like sentences and stock prices over a period of time.

It differs from a normal feedforward network 
because there is a feedback loop in its architecture. 
It also includes a special unit known as a memory cell 
to withhold the past information for a longer time for making an effective prediction.

In fact, LSTM with its memory cells is an improved version of traditional RNNs 
which cannot predict using such a long sequence of data and run into the problem of vanishing gradient.
